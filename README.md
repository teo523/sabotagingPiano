## The Sabotaging Piano
This Pure Data project provides a way of implementing the Sabotaging Piano, an electronic (MIDI) prepared piano that remaps keys into unexpected pitches. Through an expression pedal performers decide the amount of keys to be remapped, thus allowing them to continuously move from a non-modified
piano (pedal not pressed), to a fully remapped one.

Download the .zip project and open the SabotagePiano.pd to use. You will find a slider to set the level of remapping. You can connect a MIDI controller to use and then remap the outcoming pitches according to the pedal level.
